 *    the fields that determine the onchain effect. Retrying the same work yields
 *    the same key, so it is replayed instead of executed twice.
 *
 * 3. AN OUTCOME YOU CAN ASK FOR AGAIN. Every execution returns an `executionId`.
 *    After any failure, `get_execution_status` answers "what actually happened"

Send tokens through KeeperHub rather than through the local wallet.

The order is always: simulate, abort if it would revert, then execute once with
an idempotency key derived from taskId.

Inputs:
- recipientAddress: the 0x… recipient address
- amount: whole units, for example "1.5", NOT wei
- tokenAddress: the ERC-20 contract address; omit for the native token
- taskId: a stable identifier for this work, for example an invoice number

Important:
- Use the SAME taskId when retrying the same work. That is what prevents paying
  twice.
- Use a DIFFERENT taskId for payments that really are different.

taskId is the DURABLE handle, not executionId. executionId arrives inside the
response, and the response is exactly what gets lost when something goes wrong.
If the response is lost, call this action again with the same taskId: the same
key is derived and the same executionId comes back without executing again.

Keep both if you can. If you can keep only one, keep taskId.

Limit: recovery through taskId lasts 24 hours. After that the same key will
EXECUTE AGAIN, not replay. For work that can outlive a day, put a time bucket in
the taskId.
