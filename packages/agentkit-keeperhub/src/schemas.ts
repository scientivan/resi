 * Note what is NOT here: `calldata`, `data`, `abi`, and `simulate`.
 *
 * - Raw calldata is never requested from the model. The model picks the
 *   recipient, amount and token; code builds the transaction. Same idea as an
 *   address book: models cannot be relied on to produce correct hex.
 * - `simulate` is not a parameter. This provider ALWAYS simulates first and
 *   refuses on `wouldRevert`. Making it optional would let the model turn it
 *   off, and would open the misspelling class KeeperHub tracks in issue #2004
 *   (a misspelled body key is accepted silently and the transaction is
 *   broadcast for real).
